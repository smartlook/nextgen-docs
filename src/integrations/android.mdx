# Android Integration

1. Add Smartlook in your appâ€™s build.gradle:
2. i-mplementation('com. smartlook.recording:app:1.4.2-native')
3. Add Smartlook Maven repository in your projects build.gradle:
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/release"
    }
  }
}

Setup and start Smartlook in onCreate() of your Application class:
Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(String YOUR_API_KEY)
NOTE: You need to provide your Smartlook SDK API key which can be acquired in the Smartlook Dashboard.

NOTE: SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard.

After this basic setup SDK will:
- record your application.
- stop itself automatically on application closure.
- automatically hide some default sensitive views.
- detect basic user gestures and touches.
- records install referrer if present.
- and much more!

For any SDK customization please refer to our api reference.

EXAMPLE: Application class with example call of Smartlook SDK setupAndStart:

i-mport android.app.Application;

public class MyCustomApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(YOUR_API_KEY);
    }
}
