# Xamarin

Smartlook SDK is provided in the form of a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Smartlook/), and is currently in the prerelease state.

## Quick Start 

To start recording, you need your unique API key. This can be found in your apps settings in [Smartlook Dashboard](https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects).

To access Smartlook API, use static methods exposed by `Smartlook.Analytics` class. The methods are the same for multi-platform, Android or iOS projects.

The most straightforward way to run Smartlook is by calling the following method at the very begin of the app life-cycle (e.g., iOS: `AppDelegates`â€™s `FinishedLaunching`, Android: `Application` class `OnCreate`):

<Code
  snippets={{
    csharp: `
using Smartlook;
  
...
  
Smartlook.Analytics.SetupAndStart("your-app-sdk-key");
      `,
  }}
/>

[Note: the following should be in common text included into all SDK installtation docs]

Thats all you need for a quick start.

<Alert kind="info" invisibleOn="">
SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard.
</Alert>

After this basic setup SDK will:
- record your application.
- stop itself automatically on application closure.
- automatically hide some default sensitive views.
- detect basic user gestures and touches.
- records install referrer if present.
- and much more!

For any SDK customization please refer to [Smartlook API reference](/api_reference?platform=xamarin).
