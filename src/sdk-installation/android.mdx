# Android SDK Installation

1. Add Smartlook in your **appâ€™s** `build.gradle`:

<Code
  snippets={{
    gradle: `
implementation('com.smartlook.recording:app:1.5.0-native')
`,
  }}
/>

2. Add Smartlook Maven repository in your **projects** `build.gradle`:

<Code
  snippets={{
    gradle: `
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/release"
    }
  }
}
`,
  }}
/>

3.Setup and start Smartlook in **onCreate()** of your **Application** class:

<Code
  snippets={{
      java: `
public class MyCustomApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(YOUR_API_KEY);
    }
}
      `,
      kotlin: `
class MyCustomApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(YOUR_API_KEY)
    }
}
      `,
  }}
/>
