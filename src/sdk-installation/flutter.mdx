# Flutter

To add Smartlook into your Flutter project, app id as another dependency to your public `pubspec.yaml`

<Code
  snippets={{
    yaml: `
dependencies:
  smartlook:
`,
  }}
/>

## Quick Start

To start recording, call the following as early as possible in the app lifecycle (e.g., when initializing your app state):

<Code
  snippets={{
    dart: `
Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording('YOUR_API_KEY');
`,
  }}
/>

[Note: the following should be in common text included into all SDK installtation docs]

Thats all you need for a quick start.

<Alert kind="info" invisibleOn="">
SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard.
</Alert>

After this basic setup SDK will:
- record your application.
- stop itself automatically on application closure.
- automatically hide some default sensitive views.
- detect basic user gestures and touches.
- records install referrer if present.
- and much more!

For any SDK customization please refer to [Smartlook API reference](/api_reference?platform=flutter).
