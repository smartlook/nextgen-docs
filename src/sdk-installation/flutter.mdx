# Flutter SDK Installation

To add Smartlook into your Flutter project, add our wrapper as another dependency to your public `pubspec.yaml`

<Code
  snippets={{
    yaml: `
dependencies:
  smartlook:
`,
  }}
/>

# Start Recording

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
To setup Smartlook, you need your unique API key. This can be found in your mobile project settings in <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">your Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

To start recording (or just to setup the SDK), best place is  :

<Code
  snippets={{
    dart: `
import 'package:smartlook/smartlook.dart';\n
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
	@override
	void initState() {
		super.initState();
		...
		Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording('API_KEY');
		...
	  }
}
`,
  }}
/>

More info about the wrapper with additional examples can be found at [pub.dev site.](https://pub.dev/packages/smartlook#-readme-tab-)

<TextBlock kind="note">
{`
SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard. For more details about when your recordings appear in the Dashboard, refer <Link to="/conceptual/when-i-will-see-the-recordings-in-dashboard">this detailed document</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

# What will SDK do?

After this basic setup SDK will:
* record your application.
* **stop itself automatically on application closure**.
* detect basic user gestures and touches.
* records install referrer if present.
* and much more!
