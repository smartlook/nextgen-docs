# Flutter SDK Installation

To add Smartlook into your Flutter project, add our wrapper as another dependency to your public `pubspec.yaml`

<Code
  snippets={{
    yaml: `
dependencies:
  smartlook:
`,
  }}
/>

# Start Recording

<Alert kind="important">
To setup Smartlook, you need your unique API key. This can be found in your mobile project settings in <a href="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">your Smartlook Dashboard</a>.
</Alert>

To start recording (or just to setup the SDK), best place is  :

<Code
  snippets={{
    dart: `
import 'package:smartlook/smartlook.dart';
\n
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
	@override
	void initState() {
		super.initState();
		...
		Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording('API_KEY');
		...
	  }
}
`,
  }}
/>

More info about the wrapper with additional examples can be found at [pub.dev site.](https://pub.dev/packages/smartlook#-readme-tab-)

_[Note: the following should be IMHO a in common text included into all SDK installtation docs]_

<Alert kind="note" invisibleOn="">
SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard. For more details about when your recordings appear in the Dashboard, refer <a href="/conceptual/when-i-will-see-the-recordings-in-dashboard">this detailed document</a>.
</Alert>

Thats all you need for a quick start.

**After this basic setup SDK will:**
- record your application.
- stop itself automatically on application closure.
<TextBlock invisibleOn="unity,unreal,cocos,flutter"><li />automatically hide some default sensitive views.</TextBlock>
- detect basic user gestures and touches.
<TextBlock invisibleOn="ios"><li />records install referrer if present.</TextBlock>
- and much more!


For more advanced recording customization please refer to [Smartlook API reference](/api_reference?platform=flutter).
