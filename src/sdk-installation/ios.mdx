<Code
  snippets={{

To setup Smartlook, you need your unique API key. This can be found in your mobile project settings in <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">your Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

<Code
  snippets={{
      swift: `
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n
    Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
    Smartlook.startRecording()
      `,
      objc: `
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n    
    [Smartlook setupWithKey: @"YOUR_API_KEY"];
    [Smartlook startRecording];
      `,
    }
  }
/>

<TextBlock kind="note">

SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard. For more details about when your recordings appear in the Dashboard, refer <Link to="/conceptual/when-i-will-see-the-recordings-in-dashboard">this detailed document</Link>.

* record your application.
* **stop itself automatically on application closure**.
