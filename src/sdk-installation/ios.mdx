# iOS SDK Installation

1. When using **Cocoapods**, add the Smartlok Pod to your `Podfile`.

<Code
  snippets={{
    ruby: `
pod Smartlook
`,
  }}
/>

otherwise, download the latest [Smartlook iOS SDK](https://sdk.smartlook.com/ios/smartlook-ios-sdk-1.2.5.59.zip), unzip the file and add `Smartlook.framework` to your Xcode project.

2. Add `Smartlook` to your `AppDelegate` among other imports, then *setup* and *start* recording in the application's `didFinishLaunching` method:

<Code
  snippets={{
      swift: `
import Smartlook
...
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n
    Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
    Smartlook.startRecording()
      `,
      'objective-c': `
#import <Smartlook/Smartlook.h>
...
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n    
    [Smartlook setupWithKey: @"YOUR_API_KEY"];
    [Smartlook startRecording];
      `,
    }
  }
/>

# Supported versions

Current **minimal** supported version is **iOS 10**.
