# iOS SDK Installation

There are several possible ways how to integrate Smartlook SKD into a native iOS (Swift or ObjC project).

Note: if you integrate Smartlook SDK using Segment, please please follow this [LINK]

## Cocoapods

<Code
  snippets={{
    ruby: `
pod Smartlook
`,
  }}
/>

More about Cocoapods https://cocoapods.org.

## Manual Integration

1. Download the latest [Smartlook iOS SDK](https://sdk.smartlook.com/ios/smartlook-ios-sdk-1.2.5.59.zip) directly.
2. Unzip the file and add Smartlook.framework to your Xcode project.

## Quick Start 

To start recording, you need your unique API key. This can be found in your apps settings in [Smartlook Dashboard](https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects).

In your `AppDelegate` add among other imports
<Code
  snippets={{
    swift: `
import Smartlook
      `,
      objc: `
#import <Smartlook/Smartlook.h>
      `,
  }}
/>

and then in the application launch method 

<CodeBlock
  snippets={{
      swift: `
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    
    Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
    Smartlook.startRecording()
      `,
      objc: `
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
      
    [Smartlook setupWithKey:];
    [Smartlook startRecording];
      `,
    }
  }
/>

<Code
  snippets={{
    swift: `
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    
    Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
    Smartlook.startRecording()
      `,
      objc: `
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
      
    [Smartlook setupWithKey:];
    [Smartlook startRecording];
      `,
  }}
/>

[Note: the following should be in common text included into all SDK installtation docs]

Thats all you need for a quick start.

<Alert kind="info" invisibleOn="">
SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard.
</Alert>

After this basic setup SDK will:
- record your application.
- stop itself automatically on application closure.
- automatically hide some default sensitive views.
- detect basic user gestures and touches.
- records install referrer if present.
- and much more!

For any SDK customization please refer to [Smartlook API reference](/api_reference?platform=ios).
