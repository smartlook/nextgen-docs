# iOS SDK Installation

There are several possible ways how to integrate Smartlook SKD into a native iOS (Swift or ObjC project).

Note: if you integrate Smartlook SDK using Segment, please follow these instead [this document](/sdk-installation/segment).

## Cocoapods

<CodeBlock
  snippets={{
    ios: {
      ruby: `
pod Smartlook
      `,
    },
  }}
/>

More about Cocoapods https://cocoapods.org.

## Manual Integration

1. Download the latest [Smartlook iOS SDK](https://sdk.smartlook.com/ios/smartlook-ios-sdk-1.2.5.59.zip) directly.
2. Unzip the file and add Smartlook.framework to your Xcode project.

## Quick Start 

To start recording, you need your unique API key. This can be found in your apps settings in [Smartlook Dashboard](https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects).

In your `AppDelegate` add among other imports
<CodeBlock
  snippets={{
    ios: {
      swift: `
import Smartlook
      `,
      objc: `
#import <Smartlook/Smartlook.h>
      `,
    },
  }}
/>

and then in the application launch method 

<CodeBlock
  snippets={{
    ios: {
      swift: `
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    
    Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
    Smartlook.startRecording()
      `,
      objc: `
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
      
    [Smartlook setupWithKey:];
    [Smartlook startRecording];
      `,
    },
  }}
/>


Note: the following should be in common text included into all integrations

Thats all you need for a quick start.

NOTE: SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard.

After this basic setup SDK will:
- record your application.
- stop itself automatically on application closure.
- automatically hide some default sensitive views.
- detect basic user gestures and touches.
- records install referrer if present.
- and much more!

For any SDK customization please refer to [Smartlook API reference](/api_reference?platform=iOS).
