# Unity SDK Installation

## Installation for Android - aar

1. Download [Smartlook Android Unity SDK v1.5.0](https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/app-1.5.0-unity.aar).
2. Put `AAR` file to `Assets/Plugins/Android` in your Unity project.
3. Get Unity bridge from [our Github repository](https://github.com/smartlook/unity-bridge).

**Note: For stability/performance goals, currently we support Android 23+ Soon we will introduce new SDK version with broader API range, probably Android 18+**

## Installation for Android - Gradle

In case there is a conflict with other libraries, we also released lite version of the SDK. This solution however needs to be implemented via gradle of the app itself. Steps are described below. Flow is similar to integration of our native SDK.

- 1: Add the following in your project's build.gradle:

```Gradle
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/release"
    }
  }
}
```


- 2: Add the following dependency in your app's build.gradle:

```Gradle
implementation('com.smartlook.recording:app:1.5.0-unity-lite')
```


- 3: In case you are missing some of the dependencies, feel free to add:

```Gradle
implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8:1.3.61'
```


4. Get Unity bridge from [our Github repository](https://github.com/smartlook/unity-bridge).

**Note: For stability/performance goals, currently we support Android 24+ Soon we will introduce new SDK version with broader API range, probably Android 18+**

## Installation for iOS

1. Download [Smartlook iOS Unity SDK v1.3.1](https://sdk.smartlook.com/ios/smartlook-unity-ios-sdk-1.3.1.50.zip).
2. Unzip the archive and put `SmartlookUnity.framework` to `Assets/Plugins/iOS` in your Unity project.
3. Get Unity bridge from [our Github repository](https://github.com/smartlook/unity-bridge).

**Smartlook Unity iOS SDK works with Metal graphics API only. OpenGL is not supported at the moment.**

## Unity Jar Resolver

Currently this option is still in progress - Please let us know if this is somehow blocking issue to you.


# Start Recording

<Alert kind="important">
To setup Smartlook, you need your unique API key. This can be found in your mobile project settings in <a href="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">your Smartlook Dashboard</a>.
</Alert>

To start recording (or just to setup the SDK), you can use i.e.  :

<Code
  snippets={{
    csharp: `
public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        SmartlookUnity.Smartlook.SetupAndStartRecording("API_KEY");
    }
\n
    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        ...
    }
}
`,
  }}
/>

_[Note: the following should be IMHO a in common text included into all SDK installtation docs]_

<Alert kind="note" invisibleOn="">
SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard. For more details about when your recordings appear in the Dashboard, refer <a href="/conceptual/when-i-will-see-the-recordings-in-dashboard">this detailed document</a>.
</Alert>

Thats all you need for a quick start.

**After this basic setup SDK will:**
- record your application.
- stop itself automatically on application closure.
<TextBlock invisibleOn="unity,unreal,cocos,flutter"><li />automatically hide some default sensitive views.</TextBlock>
- detect basic user gestures and touches.
<TextBlock invisibleOn="ios"><li />records install referrer if present.</TextBlock>
- and much more!


For more advanced recording customization please refer to [Smartlook API reference](/api_reference?platform=unity).
