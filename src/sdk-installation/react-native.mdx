# Smartlook SDK React Native Installation

[NOTE BLOCK]
### Managed Expo projects

**Managed Expo apps can't be supported** due to the explicit technical restrictions imposed by Expo. For details, see [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/introduction/faq/), the FAQ "How do I add custom native code to my Expo project?". Smartlook functionality must be implemented in the native code.

Install the Smartlook RN bridge:

`$ npm install smartlook-react-native-wrapper --save`

[ANDROID]

1. Open `android/build.gradle`
2. Update gradle version to `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.0'` in case you are using older React native version
3. Add our maven repository:

```android
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/release"
    }
  }
}
```
Also edit `gradle-wrapper.properties` so you are using: `gradle-4.4-all.zip` -> This step is not needed in newer React native versions. 

[iOS]

Smartlook native library is installed as a Cocoapods dependency. See hwo you could create a vanilla React Native iOS app with Smartlook running in our cookbooks here [/coockbooks/vanilla-react-native-ios-app]

For React Native before v 0.60, the installation was different. If you install Smartlook into a RN app version lesser than 0.60, or upgrade RN from version 0.60 to current version, see our tips in [/cookbooks/ios-react-native-0.60-issues-troubleshooting].


# Smartlook SDK Quick Start

```js
var Smartlook = require('smartlook-react-native-wrapper');
Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording("KEY");
```
