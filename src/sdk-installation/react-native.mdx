# Smartlook SDK React Native Installation

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
**Managed Expo apps can't be supported** due to the explicit technical restrictions imposed by Expo. For details, see [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/introduction/faq/), the FAQ "_How do I add custom native code to my Expo project?_". Smartlook functionality must be implemented in the native code.
`}
</TextBlock>


**1. Install the Smartlook RN bridge**

<Code
  snippets={{
      npm: `
npm install smartlook-react-native-wrapper --save
`,
      yarn: `  
yarn add smartlook-react-native-wrapper 
`,
    }
  }
/>

**2. Add dependency on native Smartlook SDK**

*Android* 

* Open `android/build.gradle` 
* Update gradle version to `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.0'` in case you are using older React native version
* Add our maven repository:

<Code
  snippets={{
      gradle: `
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/release"
    }
  }
}
`,
    }
  }
/>

Also edit `gradle-wrapper.properties` so you are using: `gradle-4.4-all.zip`. This step is not needed in newer React native versions. 

*iOS*

Smartlook native library is installed as a **Cocoapods dependency**. 

There are no manual steps required, just make sure your Cocoapod dependecies are up-to-date after Smartlook RN installation dependecy.

**3. Import Smartlook, setup it and start recording**

<Code
  snippets={{
      javascript: `
var Smartlook = require('smartlook-react-native-wrapper');
Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording("KEY");
`,
    }
  }
/>

# Important things to know

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
- To setup Smartlook, you need your unique API key. This can be found in your mobile project settings in <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">your Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
- SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard. For more details about when your recordings appear in the Dashboard, refer <Link to="/conceptual/when-i-will-see-the-recordings-in-dashboard">this detailed document</Link>.
- If you are experiencing any technical difficulties with our SDK feel free to report a issue to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/smartlook/smartlook-ios-sdk).
