# Smartlook SDK React Native Installation

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
**Managed Expo apps can't be supported** due to the explicit technical restrictions imposed by Expo. For details, see [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/introduction/faq/), the FAQ "_How do I add custom native code to my Expo project?_". Smartlook functionality must be implemented in the native code.
`}
</TextBlock>

## Installation

Install the Smartlook RN bridge:

<Code
  snippets={{
      bash: `$ npm install smartlook-react-native-wrapper --save`,
    }
  }
/>

### Android

1. Open `android/build.gradle`
2. Update gradle version to `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.0'` in case you are using older React native version
3. Add our maven repository:

<Code
  snippets={{
      gradle: `
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/release"
    }
  }
}
`,
    }
  }
/>

Also edit `gradle-wrapper.properties` so you are using: `gradle-4.4-all.zip` -> This step is not needed in newer React native versions. 

### iOS

Smartlook native library is installed as a Cocoapods dependency. See how you could create a vanilla React Native iOS app with Smartlook running in our cookbooks here <Link to="/coockbooks/vanilla-react-native-ios-app">iOS React Native App</Link>.

<!--
For React Native before v 0.60, the installation was different. If you install Smartlook into a RN app version lesser than 0.60, or upgrade RN from version 0.60 to current version, see our tips in [/cookbooks/ios-react-native-0.60-issues-troubleshooting].
-->

# Smartlook SDK Quick Start

<Code
  snippets={{
      javascript: `
var Smartlook = require('smartlook-react-native-wrapper');
Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording("KEY");
`,
    }
  }
/>

Detailed Smartlook API documentation could be found here <Link to="/api_reference">API Reference</Link>.

<TextBlock kind="note">
{`
SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard. For more details about when your recordings appear in the Dashboard, refer <Link to="/conceptual/when-i-will-see-the-recordings-in-dashboard">this detailed document</Link>
`}
</TextBlock>

# What will SDK do?

After this basic setup SDK will:
* record your application.
* **stop itself automatically on application closure**.
* automatically hide some default sensitive views.
* detect basic user gestures and touches.
* records install referrer if present.
* and much more!
