# Installation

1. Add cordova plugin to your project using this command:

<Code
  snippets={{
    cli: `
cordova plugin add https://github.com/smartlook/cordova-smartlook.git
`,
  }}
/>

2. Setup and start Smartlook on [deviceready](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.1.1/cordova/events/events.deviceready.html) callback:

<Code
  snippets={{
      javascript: `
if(document.readyState === "complete") {
  document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
}\n
function onDeviceReady() {
    Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording({smartlookAPIKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"});
}
      `,
  }}
/>

<Alert kind="important">
You need to provide your Smartlook SDK API key which can be acquired in the Smartlook Dashboard.
</Alert>

<Alert kind="note">
SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard.
</Alert>

# What will SDK do?

After this basic setup SDK will:
* record your application.
* **stop itself automatically on application closure**.
* automatically hide all input elements (besides `button` and `submit` types).
* detect basic user gestures and touches.
* and much more!

# Supported versions
Current **minimal** supported version is **Jelly Bean (API 18)** for Android and **10** for iOS.

# Issue tracker
If you are experiencing any technical difficulties with our SDK feel free to report a issue to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/smartlook/cordova-smartlook).
