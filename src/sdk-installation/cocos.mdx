# Cocos SDK Installation

## Android

In case you want to use SDK in Android project add these lines to your gradle project file:

<Code
  snippets={{
    gradle: `
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/release"
    }
  }
}
`,
  }}
/>

Also add this line to your module gradle: `implementation('com.smartlook.recording:app:1.4.2-cocos')`

<Code
  snippets={{
    gradle: `
implementation('com.smartlook.recording:app:1.5.0-native')
`,
  }}
/>

### Start Recording

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
To setup Smartlook, you need your unique API key. This can be found in your mobile project settings in <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">your Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

<Code
  snippets={{
      java: `
public class AppActivity extends Cocos2dxActivity {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        ...
        // DO OTHER INITIALIZATION BELOW
        Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(YOUR_API_KEY);
    }
}
      `,
      kotlin: `
class AppActivity : Cocos2dxActivity() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        ...
        // DO OTHER INITIALIZATION BELOW
        Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(YOUR_API_KEY)
    }
}
      `,
  }}
/>

## iOS

Coming soon

<TextBlock kind="note">
{`
SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard. For more details about when your recordings appear in the Dashboard, refer <Link to="/conceptual/when-i-will-see-the-recordings-in-dashboard">this detailed document</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

* **stop itself automatically on application closure**.
* automatically hide some default sensitive views.
* detect basic user gestures and touches.
* records install referrer if present.
* and much more!
