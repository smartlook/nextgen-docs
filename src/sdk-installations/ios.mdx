```swift
  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        
    Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
    Smartlook.startRecording()`
```

### ObjC

In your `AppDelegate.m` add among other imports

```objc
#import <Smartlook/Smartlook.h>
```

then in `- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions`

```objc
  - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
        
    [Smartlook setupWithKey:@"YOUR_API_KEY"];
    [Smartlook startRecording];
```

*Note: the following should be in common text included into all integrations*

Thats all you need for a quck start.

NOTE: SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard.

After this basic setup SDK will:
- record your application.
- stop itself automatically on application closure.
- automatically hide some default sensitive views.
- detect basic user gestures and touches.
- records install referrer if present.
- and much more!

For any SDK customization please refer to our api reference.
