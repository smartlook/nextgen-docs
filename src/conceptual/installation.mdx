# Installation

This section covers the SDK installation in various environments. Initializing recording is then described in the next chapter.

Smartlook SDK is a native software library. It could be either installed as such, or packaged for easy integration with various development platforms.

The installation thus depends on the toolkit with which is your app developed, and on packaging system your project uses to maintain external dependencies:
