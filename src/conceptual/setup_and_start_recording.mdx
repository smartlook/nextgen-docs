# Setup & Start Recording

This section deals with how to setup Smartlook SDK and start recording your app.

To start recording, just put the following code into your application. Once you run your app on a device or in a simulator, recording will appear in your dashboard (link to the dashboard).

In order to function properly, the setup should happen as soon as possible in the app life cycle:

[TABS PER PLATFORM & LANGUAGE, MANUALLY SWITCHABLE?]

In AppDelegate.swift:
 
```
include Smartlook
 
...
 
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
 
   Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
   Smartlook.startRecording()
}
```


This is basically all you need to record your sessions. All other events in the app life cycle are handled by Smartlook automatically.

Note: common startup issues: 

- it may take several minutes before the recordings appear in the Dashboard. The recording is not streamed, it is uploaded in chunks and then processed on the server. 
- in the default setup, recordings are not uploaded when the device is on a mobile network. In order to see the recordings immediately, please make sure the device is on WiFi (link to documentation & dashboard). 

## Setup Options Overview
Smartlook recording could be customized by several parameters. Some of the recording customization options could be set by dedicated methods, some others can be only/also set as startup options.
 
Not all options are available on all platforms. For most options, there is also a dedicated method or property that can set it later in the app life-cycle.

For comprehensive list of all options and other details, consult your platform documentation [LINK TO SETUP METHOD IN API REFERENCE]
