# iOS technical note: “Main Thread Checker” warning

When debugging your app with Smartlook, you will encounter a warning which title reads

`Main Thread Checker: UI API called on a background thread: -[UIView drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:]`

The warning is harmless, and is caused by capturing screen on background. The alternative (capturing the screenshot on the main thread) may cause glitches of the app UI - so implementing it this way and having this warning is a necessary trade-off to enable recording functionality.

This warning also might be accompanied by a short freeze of the app during debugging. This freeze does not happen in production builds, and is caused by an [Xcode debug option](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/diagnosing_memory_thread_and_crash_issues_early). This option can be switched off in the respective run scheme diagnostic options:
