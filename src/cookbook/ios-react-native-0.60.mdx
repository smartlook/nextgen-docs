#### Cocoapods troubleshooting (RN 0.60.0 and higher)

When you are using Cocoapods, you cannot use ~`react-native link`~. 

To make sure the module is not linked the old way, call `$ react-native unlink smartlook-react-native-wrapper`

When upgrading from an older, non-cocoapods version, make also sure there is no older version of `Smartlook.framework` bundled in your app. To check it out, 
1. remove the smartlook-related line from your Podfile
2. run `$ pod install` in your app `ios` directory to remove smartlook bridge from your app
3. manually remove any `Smartlook.framework` that you find in your app Xcode project.
4. clear all caches as described below and add the smartlook reference to your `Podfile` again

It aways helps to reset the environment by
- cleaning caches: `$ watchman watch-del-all; rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
- killing the Metro Bundler

### Legacy iOS framework linking (RN before 0.60.0)

The native `Smartlook.framework` is no longer part of the installed bridge. 

If you need it for creating your own bridge, or if the traditional `$ react-native link  smartlook-react-native-wrapper` works for you, [download the latest version here](https://smartlook.github.io/docs/sdk/ios/#manual-installation) and add it manually to your iOS Xcode project. This makes you also responsible for its updates to latest versions.

The RN bridge files that proxy the native SDK into React Native and the native framework header files are still distributed as part of the installed bridge.

Please note that `$ react-native link  smartlook-react-native-wrapper` may or may not work depending on many factors like React Native version etc. and may require some additional Xcode project tweaking which depends on your particular toolchain setup.
