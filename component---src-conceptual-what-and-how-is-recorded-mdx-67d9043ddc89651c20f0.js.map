For details, see <Link to=\"/conceptual/screen-recording-quality\">Screen Recording Quality</Link>.\n \nThe level of recorded visual details is given by the rendering mode. The default mode is **native**, when Smartlook takes screenshots of the device screen, removes sensitive data from it and then composes video out of it. Alternative rendering modes construct the video recording by sketching the UI structure in one of several **wireframe** styles.
