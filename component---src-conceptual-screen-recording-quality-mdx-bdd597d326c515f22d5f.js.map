Technically, this option sets primarily the video bitrate, which affects the video image quality and size of the video data. For most projects, Medium has a best price-performance ratio. When the app is used in an environment where data size that is sent from the app matters, Low might be the best option. For apps where the high image quality of the recordings is important, and data size does not matter much, High can be used.`}</p>\n    <p>{`With each quality, an estimated size of the data is quoted. The real data size depends on many factors (how complex the UI is, how often it changes significantly) and tends to be a fraction (½ or ⅓ ) of the maximal size.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Technologically, this setting affects the memory footprint of the SDK, its CPU load and primarily the size of the data that the SDK sends over the network.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"framerate\"\n    }}>{`Framerate`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Framerate (in frames per second, or fps) says how often Smartlook takes a snapshot of the screen. The higher the framerate, the “smoother” the recording of UI changes. The trade-off is, however, higher CPU load and energy consumption. For analysing user interaction in a common app, the default fps value (2fps) is quite sufficient. Higher fps makes sense in dynamic apps like games.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We recommend setting the framerate for your project on the dashboard `}{`[link here]`}{`. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Alternatively, it can also be set as one of Smartlook setup options. This is particularly useful for debugging and finding the optimal value for the app. In production releases, this option should not be used.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The given framerate, however, is the maximal value. In order to reduce the footprint, Smartlook watches the real changes in the UI and takes snapshots only when the UI is not idle. This kind of optimization, known as adaptive framerate, may not work perfectly in some edge cases with all kinds of technologies that are used to create UI. If the adaptive framerate algorithm produces unsatisfying results in these edge cases, it can be switched off by the respective Smartlook setup option. `}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"rendering-mode\"\n    }}>{`Rendering Mode`}</h2>\n    <p>{`On top of taking snapshots of the screens for the video recording, Smartlook can also present the UI in the form of several types of wireframe sketches. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Different rendering modes use different amounts of CPU, memory and produce video data of different sizes. The difference is individual for each app and depends on the way the app UI is structured. There is not always a direct relation between the simplicity of the visual presentation and resources load.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Read more about rendering modes in the “Handling Sensitive Data” section.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
